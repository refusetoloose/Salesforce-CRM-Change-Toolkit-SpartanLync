# Salesforce CRM Change Management Toolkit – SpartanLync

This repository contains a comprehensive change management solution developed for **SpartanLync**, a global fleet management company undergoing a **Salesforce CRM implementation**. The toolkit and associated deliverables were created as part of a capstone project for the **Change Management (MNGT-252)** course at the **Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT)** during Winter 2025.

## 📌 Project Overview

SpartanLync had no formal change management framework during the CRM rollout. Our team, acting as external change consultants, engaged with **Jorge Cantor (Key Account Manager, SpartanLync)** through two in-depth interviews. Based on real-time insights, we developed a tailored change management toolkit using the **ADKAR model** by Prosci, focused on communication, training, resistance management, and long-term reinforcement.
